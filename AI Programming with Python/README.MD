# AI programming with Python

Please read carefully this file before asking for support.

## Project 1: Used a pre-trained image classifier to identify dog breeds
  
### Context: this first project was mainly intended to make student practice Python and get comfortable with manipulating data structures such as lists or dictionaries.

### Project structure

### How to run

## Project 2: Created an image classifier using a trained model

### Part 1: develop a code for an image classifier built with Pytorch

#### Context: this first project was mainly intended to make student practice Python and get comfortable with manipulating data structures such as lists or dictionaries.

#### Project structure

#### How to run

Just run every single cell of the Notebook (ipynb file) top down.
The cell that can be used for testing is the one containing :
`image_to_test_path = "/data/flowers/test/25/image_06583.jpg"
probs, classes = predict(image_to_test_path, model)
display_image_results(image_to_test_path)`

Mainly:
* specify an image filename
* predict the classification of that image
* display the results graphically
